Question: What class should implement the Comparable interface?
Answer: The Media class should implement the Comparable interface.

Question: In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo() method be to reflect the ordering that we want?
Answer: We should implement compareTo() based on the natural ordering of Media, for example, by Title. 
If (this.title < other.title) return negative; 
If (this.title > other.title) return positive;
Else return 0.

Question: Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
Answer: No. The Comparable interface only allows defining a single "natural" sorting order for the class. To support multiple sorting rules (like "Title then Cost" AND "Cost then Title"), we must use the Comparator interface as implemented in the lab.

Question: Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
Answer: We can override the compareTo() method specifically inside the DigitalVideoDisc class to include the length comparison logic. However, a better approach is to create a specific Comparator for DVD (e.g., DVDComparatorByTitleLengthCost) to keep the sorting logic separate from the class definition.
